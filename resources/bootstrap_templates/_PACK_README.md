# SCG Claude Pack

This bundle contains per-repository `.claude/CLAUDE.md` files for SupplyChainGuard repositories.

How to use:
- Copy the matching folder into each repository root (or just the `.claude/` folder).
- Keep `CLAUDE.md` under version control.
- Treat it as the contract for AI-assisted changes.
